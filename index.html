			<th><img src="donyaconsolacion.jpeg" alt= "consolacion" width="200"></th>
			<td class="chars">Donya Consolacion</td>
 			 <td>
 			 <div> 
 			 <ul>
                   <li> In Jose Rizal's "Noli Me Tangere," the character Donya Consolacion, who is portrayed as a harsh and domineering figure, also experiences mistreatment and abuse at the hands of her husband, Alperes.

					<li>While Donya Consolacion may be cruel and oppressive toward her servants, she, too, becomes a victim within her own domestic sphere. Her husband, Alperes, is depicted as a drunkard who often abuses her physically. This aspect of their relationship serves to underscore the pervasive nature of abuse and the cyclical nature of mistreatment that can occur in hierarchical and authoritarian systems.</li>

					<li>Rizal's portrayal of Donya Consolacion as both an oppressor and a victim adds depth to her character and highlights the broader themes of oppression, abuse, and the corrosive impact of the colonial society depicted in the novel. It reminds readers that individuals trapped in oppressive systems can also suffer themselves, perpetuating a cycle of violence and control.</li>
